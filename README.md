This is a repo for bioreactor optimization using machine learning. Refer to BioreactorOptimization_organized.ipynb for an introduction to the project, all code, and descriptions of other files. 

The purpose of this project is to recreate the work of the following paper:

Y. Ma, D. A. Noreña-Caro, A. J. Adams, T. B. Brentzel, J. A. Romagnoli, and M. G. Benton, “Machine-learning-based simulation and fed-batch control of cyanobacterial-phycocyanin production in Plectonema by artificial neural network and deep reinforcement learning,” Computers & Chemical Engineering, vol. 142, p. 107016, Jul. 2020, doi: 10.1016/j.compchemeng.2020.107016.
